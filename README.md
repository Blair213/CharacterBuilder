# <center> Character Builder Plugin
 <center> Plugin that nobody asked for but many of us needed.  <br />
Allows for quickly equipping character with one of saved builds.</center>

## Usage

1. In game select character that you want to build 
2. Use command `/build or !build` to get list of current available builds 
3. Use `/build BuildName` (for example /build hydrodps) to equip current character with selected build

## Expanding the build list
#### After first launch in your `Grasscutter_Folder/Plugins/CharacterBuilder` will be generated new file called `builds.json`.
There you can **add/remove/edit** current builds.  <br />
Plugin requests this file each time you use any form of `/build` command so you don't need to restart server after every change. \
I'm open for extending current build list, so if you have any good builds that you want to share, make pull request on github or dm me on discord: <a href="https://discord.com/users/276265598508466176">Penelopeep#7963</a>
